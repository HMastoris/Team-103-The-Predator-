# Team-103-The-Predator-
The Predator is a GPS and WIFI enabled Range Finder. When the user is ready to take a reading, a button is pressed which initiate the reading of GPS coordinates and distance to an object. The readings are displayed on an LCD screen and sent from the ESP32 to an MQTT broker.
Future iterations of this project would include motorized movement and motion sensors to allow the measurement to be taken on the specific object the user is looking at. Aditionally a TOF laser measurment tool would be implemented instead of an IR sensor.
